  ## Description
  This application is a refactor of an existing application which was built using Node.js and Express.js, and has been refactored to use Python and Flask for the backend. The original application used Sequelize as the ORM which in this application has changed to SqlAlchemy to work with Python. This application is a tech news blog, where logged in users can create new posts, edit posts, and upvote and comment on posts. Any user not logged in will have the ability to view posts and comments.

  Deployed Application: https://polar-refuge-82117.herokuapp.com
